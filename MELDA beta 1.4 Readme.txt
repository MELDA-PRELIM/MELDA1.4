MELDA BETA 1.1
- For hardware triggering, set default my_trigger.polarity = 0.
- In bw_DoWork() function, after flycap2.GrabImage(), if my_triggers.polarity == 0, then set my_triggers.polarity = 1, and vice versa.
- In flycap2_ImageGrabbed event, if it is time to save to disc, then FlyCap1.DrawSingleImage(0); this means that the program only draws one frame per second, which is probably much more manageable.

BETA 1.2
- During free run mode (to adjust substrate and focus), the following attributes are set to one-push i.e. it will auto-adjust only once, then come under manual control:
a. brightness
b. gain
c. gamma
d. hue
e. iris
f. saturation
g. whitebalance

- During recording, the above attributes will be in manual mode. Values determined by one-push during the substrate adjustement will be used.

BETA 1.3
- Removed one-push capability during free run mode to avoid possibility of recording settings screwing up.
- Gain, Gamma and Sharpness are no longer on auto mode. They are now controlled via absolute value registers, where inputs come from either numeric updown boxes or sliders. 
- Sliders will update numeric updown boxes and vice versa

BETA 1.4
- Add capability to view difference and sum images once every N seconds (where N is integration time) in new window.
- Divide diff_array[] and sum_array[] entries by the number of seconds taken to accumulate the data so that it will always fit within a 16 bit signed integer. If max pixel value per frame = 255, and max rate of accumulation is 60 FPS per array, then max value = 15300, which fits in a short.
